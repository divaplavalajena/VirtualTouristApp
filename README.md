# VirtualTouristApp

An iPhone app that allows users to tour the world without leaving the 
comforts of their couch. This app allows users to drop pins on a map and 
pull up Flickr images associated with that location. Locations and images 
are stored using Core Data.

Pins may be added with a touch to the map or deleted using the edit button.
Images attached to the pin may be deleted or refreshed for a new set of pictures.
